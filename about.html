        <p>Hi, I was born in September 29, 1996.<br> My school was Udayan Higher Secondary School & College.<br> Later I started my college in Dhaka College, Dhaka.<br> After completing my graduation from there,<br> I got myself admitted in Engineering in<br>            Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET).<br> My field of study was ETE (Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering).<br> After studying for 4 years I figured out that <br> I was never interested in Electrical field I was
            <br> always loving coding and programming 24/7.<br> So, I started self studying CSE (Computer Science and Engineering).<br> I taught myself C, C++, Python, HTML5, CSS, Robotics, Java, ES6 etc.<br> My hobby is making AI based architectures
            for real life purposes.
